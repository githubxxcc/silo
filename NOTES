** How Dependencies are being tracked? **
A new tuple is inserted to the btree everytime when there is an operation. 
It starts with funcitons call from the benchmark, which modifies the btree. 

[Function Call]:
tpcc.cc: load()/txn_new_order()
- txn_btree.h : insert()/put()/update()... 
    -> base_txn_btree.h : do_tree_put()
        -> txn_impl.h : try_insert_new_tuple()



** How dependencies are being enforced? ** 
When tranaction is being committed, versions and locks are checked in the commit() function following the routine described by the protocol in paper. 

[Function Call]:
- txn_impl.h : commit() 


** Persistency version implementation ** 
SiloR related codes can be found int he txn_proto2_impl.cc/h files.
